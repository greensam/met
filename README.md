# met
messing with the Met API and putting GPT 4 to the test.

## GPT Steps:

1. Asked GPT 4 to create a ruby on rails guide showing me how to create a website that accessed the MET API.
2. Amended the request so that it worked through setup steps using VSCode to do all of the work in the browser.
3. Asked GPT to amend the dev environment setup from `Gitpod` to `Github Codespaces` because the first generation didn't work. 

## Human Steps

1. Create a repo for the project on Github.
2. Cloned the repo via VSCode in the browser.
3. Created `gitpod` startup files for a Ruby on Rails project (`.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`)
4. Tried to set up the image on `Gitpod` so be able to run things in a dev environment, but that failed.
5. Switching to set up using github codespaces. Skipped the step on setting up a more complex Dockerfile for now.
