# met
messing with the Met API and putting GPT 4 to the test.

## GPT Steps:

1. Asked GPT 4 to create a ruby on rails guide showing me how to create a website that accessed the MET API.
2. Amended the request so that it worked through setup steps using VSCode to do all of the work in the browser.

## Human Steps

1. Create a repo for the project on Github.
2. Cloned the repo via VSCode in the browser.
3. Created `gitpod` startup files for a Ruby on Rails project (`.gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`)
